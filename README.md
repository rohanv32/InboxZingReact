## üìù Design Decisions

- **React Components**: Each React component is modular and reusable, representing distinct UI parts (e.g., news card, preferences, authentication). This structure simplifies maintenance and scaling.
  
- **Card-Based News Feed**: A card layout enhances readability, allowing users to scan headlines and snippets quickly, with clear options for dismissing articles.

- **Responsive Design**: Built using CSS media queries and Grid layouts, the app provides a seamless experience across devices.

- **User-based Customization**: Customizable preferences (e.g., update frequency, language, sources) make the app flexible and tailored to individual needs, boosting engagement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Choices 

- **React**: Selected for its component-based structure, efficient rendering, and rich ecosystem, ideal for dynamic and interactive UIs.
  
- **Styled-Components**: Used for component-based styling, preventing style conflicts and aiding large-scale styling management for large apps and extensive features.

- **JavaScript**: Chosen for its popularity and seamless integration with React, allowing for a clean codebase compatible with modern tools and features.
