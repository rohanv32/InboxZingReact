## Why use InboxZing? What can we provide?

- Our primary aim is to help you as a user stay informed and engaged with the world by looking at news differently.

- The increasingly vast amount of news we have access to everyday can be a virtue and a vice, with all this information, we may feel overwhelmed and overloaded while trying to keep up with all of this in the midst of our daily schedules.

- As a whole, traditional means of news consumption, combined with the increasingly shorter attention spans we witness nowadays, can make consuming news a chore, as demonstrated by the popularity of news distribtution through social media, such as TikTok or Instagram. While this is a good way to capture the attention of a broader audience and is also personalised, the way these algorithms are set up can force us down a rabbit hole of opinions and ideas, which may or may not always be accurate.

- Most importantly, people are different, and they absorb new information in different ways. Some people tend to be auditory learners, others visual, and we all have different methods of retaining information important to us.

- InboxZing is built to address those problems, with the goal of making the experience as personalised as you would like as a user.

- With a simple, easy-to-understand interface, and news sourced directly from top media platforms, we provide you with the latest, accurate, news, and get you summrised version of the news you want, in the way you want. Be it Brief, Detailed, Humourous or Poetic, keep up with the world the way you want to.

- The points feature gives you a chance to not just gain knowlegde, but also a way to get appreciated for your efforts, and redeem interesting prizes when you hit milestones!

- By giving you your news as a podcast, we hope that this could just be another part of your daily routine that can be simplified and easily accessible, no matter how busy your day.

## üóÉÔ∏è MongoDB Rationale

We chose **MongoDB** for this project due to the following reasons:
- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB allows for dynamic schemas, ideal for a news application where user preferences and articles can vary significantly.
- **Scalability**: It can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for storing numerous articles fetched from various sources.
- **Performance**: MongoDB's document-oriented structure enables fast data retrieval, which is great for providing users with timely news updates.

Please take a look at InboxZingDatabase.pdf for the database architecture diagram.

## üìù Design Decisions

- **React Components**: Each React component is modular and reusable, representing distinct UI parts (e.g., news card, preferences, authentication). This structure simplifies maintenance and scaling.
  
- **Card-Based News Feed**: A card layout enhances readability, allowing users to scan headlines and snippets, with clear options for dismissing articles.

- **Responsive Design**: Built using CSS media queries and Grid layouts, the app provides a seamless experience across devices.

- **User-based Customization**: Customizable preferences (e.g., update frequency, language, sources) make the app flexible and tailored to individual needs, boosting engagement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Choices 

- **React**: Selected for its component-based structure, efficient rendering, and rich ecosystem, ideal for dynamic and interactive UIs.
  
- **Styled-Components**: Used for component-based styling, preventing style conflicts and aiding large-scale styling management for large apps and extensive features.

- **JavaScript**: Chosen for its popularity and seamless integration with React, allowing for a clean codebase compatible with modern tools and features.
