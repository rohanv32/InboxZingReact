## üóÉÔ∏è MongoDB Rationale

We chose **MongoDB** for this project due to the following reasons:
- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB allows for dynamic schemas, ideal for a news application where user preferences and articles can vary significantly.
- **Scalability**: It can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for storing numerous articles fetched from various sources.
- **Performance**: MongoDB's document-oriented structure enables fast data retrieval, which is great for providing users with timely news updates.

Please take a look at InboxZingDatabase.pdf for the database architecture diagram.

## üìù Design Decisions

- **React Components**: Each React component is modular and reusable, representing distinct UI parts (e.g., news card, preferences, authentication). This structure simplifies maintenance and scaling.
  
- **Card-Based News Feed**: A card layout enhances readability, allowing users to scan headlines and snippets, with clear options for dismissing articles.

- **Responsive Design**: Built using CSS media queries and Grid layouts, the app provides a seamless experience across devices.

- **User-based Customization**: Customizable preferences (e.g., update frequency, language, sources) make the app flexible and tailored to individual needs, boosting engagement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Choices 

- **React**: Selected for its component-based structure, efficient rendering, and rich ecosystem, ideal for dynamic and interactive UIs.
  
- **Styled-Components**: Used for component-based styling, preventing style conflicts and aiding large-scale styling management for large apps and extensive features.

- **JavaScript**: Chosen for its popularity and seamless integration with React, allowing for a clean codebase compatible with modern tools and features.
