## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

React, JavaScript

### Styles: 

CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohanv32/InboxZingReact.git
cd InboxZingReact
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

npm start
```

This will start the application locally on http://localhost:3000.

## Components Documentation

### App.js

The main component managing routing, global state, and the rendering of all other components. It sets up the navigation logic based on activeTab and isLoggedIn status.

### Header.js

Displays navigation tabs based on the user's logged-in status, including Home, Sign Up, Login, Preferences, News Feed, Delete User, and Logout.

### Home.js

A welcome page for unauthenticated users, providing an overview and links to Login and Sign Up pages.

### Login.js

Handles user login. Contains a form that accepts credentials and authenticates users.

### SignUp.js

Manages the user sign-up process, allowing new users to create an account and navigate to Preferences upon successful registration.

### Preferences.js

Accessible to authenticated users to adjust settings.

### NewsFeed.js

Displays personalized content for authenticated users.

### DeleteUser.js

Allows authenticated users to delete their account.

## Development Process

### Design Decisions

Modular Component Structure: Each feature is encapsulated within its own component, which promotes reusability and simplifies maintenance.

Conditional Rendering Logic: Utilizes Reactâ€™s conditional rendering to manage access to different parts of the application based on isLoggedIn and activeTab states.

Global State Management: Used Context API for global state, making it easier to manage user sessions across components.

### Technical Choices

React Router: Chose React Router for navigation and routing, allowing for dynamic, single-page navigation.

Context API: Opted for Context API to avoid prop drilling and maintain global state across the application (e.g., isLoggedIn status).

CSS Modules (if used): Modular CSS approach provides scope isolation, which prevents style collisions and enhances maintainability.

### AI Usage

Code Suggestions and Debugging: Leveraged AI for generating code snippets and troubleshooting issues during development, especially while considering CSS style implementation and conditional rendering of pages baesd on login states.

Documentation Assistance: AI was used to streamline the creation of project documentation and provide a structured approach to the README and component documentation.
